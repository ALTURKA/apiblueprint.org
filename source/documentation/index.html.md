A powerful high-level API design language for web APIs.

API Blueprint is simple and accessible to everybody involved in the API design
lifecycle. Its syntax is concise yet expressive.

With API Blueprint you can quickly prototype and model APIs to be created or
describe already deployed mission-critical APIs. From a [car][tesla] to the
largest Content Distribution Network (CDN) in the world.

The API Blueprint is built to encourage dialogue and collaboration between
project stakeholders, developers and customers at any point in the API
lifecycle. At the same time, the API Blueprint [tools][] provide the support
to achieve the goals be it API development, governance or delivery.
